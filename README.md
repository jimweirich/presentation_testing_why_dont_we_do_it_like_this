Testing -- Why Don't We Do It Like This?

# ABSTRACT

Testing is a fundamental part of the Agile process.  We live and
breath TDD/BDD. Red/Green/Refactor is our daily mantra.  We love
cucumber and writing executable customer readable specifications.  We
even write tests for our javascripts.

And yet, testing remains hard.  The tests we love to write are brittle
and tend to break when we refactor.  Although we talk about the tests
being the specification of our code, too often the specify "how its
implemented" rather than "what should be done".

This talk is about how to improve the way we do testing, how to move
away from merely specifying how our software is implemented to capturing
the true essence of how it should function.
